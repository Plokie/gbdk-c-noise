# gbdk-c-noise
A simple header file that contains procedural noise functions for use with GBDK.
Comparable to basic simplex noise, and includes an experimental perlin noise / fbm noise implementation that I don't think works but might? I'm not sure tbh, I couldn't yield useful results.

Based on the C fbm header by nowl at https://gist.github.com/nowl/828013 and modified using some fixed point stuff i made up

For information on how it works, see the header file comments
